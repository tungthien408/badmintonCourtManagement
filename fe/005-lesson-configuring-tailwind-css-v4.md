# 005 - Configuring Tailwind CSS v4

Great progress, Thien! Now let's configure Tailwind CSS v4 for your React app.

## How Tailwind CSS v4 Works

Tailwind CSS v4 is much simpler than previous versions. You just need to import it in your CSS file, and it automatically works with your React components!

## Setting Up Tailwind CSS v4

We need to replace the content of your `src/index.css` file with the Tailwind imports.

## Your Task

Replace the entire content of your `src/index.css` file with this:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS v4 is that simple.

## Test It Out

After updating `index.css`, run your development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to the URL it shows (usually http://localhost:5173).

You should see the default React + Vite page. If it loads without errors, Tailwind is working!

Let me know if you see any errors or if the page loads successfully!
